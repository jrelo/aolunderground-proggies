Introduction 

This tutorial will teach you to create your own invokes that ONLY YOU CAN SEE.

Instructions


First of all, you want to choose a text stream that you want to make into your invoke. For this tutorial we'll use my Chat Tool. 
Open a copy of AOL 4.0 or above and make sure it has the Star Tool. You don't need to sign on. 
Play the Chat Tool text stream with the Star Tool. 
Once the tool appears close AOL. 
Open the main.idx of the version of AOL you were just using with the AOL Database Viewer. WARNING: Don't ever open the main.idx at the same time that your AOL is running or vice versa because it will fuck it up bad. 
On the DBView menu go to "View" and then check "Sort Ascending". 
Now click the "Go To.." option undert the "Records" menu. 
Enter "20-0-299" in the Go To Record box. The reason for this is because 20-0-299 is where text streams are are saved in your main.idx. 
If there's more that one record called 20-0-299 highlight the very last one. If there isn't more than one just highlight the one that's there. 
On the right side of DBView there's 2 tabs at the top. One says Database and the other say Record. Click the one that says Record. 
In the GID field replace 20-0-299 with the number you want your invoke to be. Don't choose one that's already there. For this lesson I'm going to use 0-420. 
Next to "Type:" there's a drop down menu. Change "Binary" to "Stream". 
Put a check in the box marked "Permanent". 
Now go to File on the top menu and choose exit. When it says that 20-0-299 has changed click ok. 
Make sure that DBView is closed and open your AOL. 
Now go to Invoke Database Record on the Star Tool and enter 0-420. 
Watch in awe as my Chat Tool appears.
